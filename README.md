# show_uploader

show_uploader was created to assist in uploading podcast files to a remote server and assiting with getting other pieces of the podcast uploading workflow in motion. 

The script takes the podcast file as an argument and uploads it to my remote server using Paramiko. It then generates an HTML anchor tag that contains the dynamic file name that was initially passed as an argument. This anchor tag is copied into the clipboard for easy pasting into the CMS that opens automatically. The compose page on my blogging platform is presented and I can immediately paste the the anchor tag copied into the clipboard. 

Modify as you'd like.
