# show_uploader

show_uploader was created to assist in uploading podcast files to a remote server. 

The script take the file as an argument and uploads it to my remote server using Paramiko. It then generates an HTML anchor tag that contains the dynamic file name that was initially passed. This anchor tag is copied into the clipboard for easy pasting into the CMS. The webbrowser is then opened to my specific compose page on my blogging platform. I can immediately paste the the anchor tag copied into the clipboard. 

Modify as you'd like.
